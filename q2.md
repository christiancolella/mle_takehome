# Cofactor AI MLE Takehome - Part 2
Christian Colella

## Data Sources
An EMR should include:
1. Patient's medical history
2. Patient's prescriptions
3. Patient's lab results
4. Doctor's notes

Data sources that would be useful for retrieval include:

### Medical ontologies
* SNOMED CT - General clinical terminology
* ICD-10 - Diagnosis coding
* RxNorm - Medication nomenclature
* LOINC - Lab observations

### Clincial guidelines
* CDC - U.S. guidelines
* WHO - International guidelines

### Patient history
* Previous EMR/SOAP notes
* Diagnosis list
* Medication list

These souces ensure that the RAG system bases its generation in medical standards, retrieves patient-specific data, and uses evidence-based information.

## Evaluation and Optimization

We can evaluate the system by factual correctness and completeness. The information in an EMR produced through this process should overlap with the doctor's notes from visiting the patient. Additionally, all required EMR sections should be populated. A human in the loop would continuously collect user corrections and update system components where appropriate. We can iteratively improve the system by refining the LLM's prompts based on error patterns and adjusting retrieval methods if context tends to be missing.
