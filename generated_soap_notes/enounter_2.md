# Generated SOAP Note

## Subjective
Miss Jones reports headaches for the past 2-3 weeks, occurring at least 3 times per week, predominantly in the evenings. Headaches are located in the front and temples, rated about 5/10 in intensity, and have recently become a bit worse. Stress is a clear trigger, particularly during lab setups and thesis work. Excedrin Migraine provides relief. She denies nausea, vomiting, visual changes (flashes or floaters), numbness, tingling, weakness, fevers, or chills. No morning headaches. She maintains a healthy diet, exercises (hot yoga), denies recent change in caffeine intake, drug or tobacco use, and only drinks coffee daily as usual. Medical history notable for asthma (inhaler, not used in 6 months), allergy to sulfa, and no recent illnesses. Family history: father with hypertension, grandfather with lung cancer (smoker), otherwise healthy family. No other regular meds besides Excedrin.

## Objective
General: Alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, normal heart sounds.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no distress.
HEENT: Extraocular movements intact, no facial or scalp tenderness on palpation, no sinus tenderness. Pupils equal and reactive. Oral exam normal. No focal neurological deficits on cranial nerve testing, sensation intact in face, and normal strength and reflexes in upper and lower extremities. No asymmetry. No concerning findings on general physical or neurologic examination.
Musculoskeletal: Some mild tightness noted in cervical musculature, improved following OMM techniques.

## Assessment
Tension-type headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress. No red-flag symptoms (sudden onset, neurologic deficit, visual changes, constitutional symptoms) to suggest secondary causes. No evidence currently of intracranial pathology by history or exam. Headaches responding to over-the-counter medication (Excedrin), and improved with manipulation and possible stress management. Asthma stable, not currently requiring inhaler use.

## Plan
1. Continue current management with Excedrin as needed for headaches, but limit use to avoid medication overuse headache.
2. Utilize non-pharmacologic strategies: heat therapy to neck/shoulder, stress management techniques, regular exercise (continue hot yoga).
3. Consider use of relaxation techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation).
4. Educate on warning signs of more serious headaches: sudden severe headache, visual changes, persistent vomiting, neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking), new onset headaches in the morning.
5. Follow up with PCP if headaches worsen, become more frequent, or do not respond to current measures.
6. If concerning symptoms emerge, may consider further investigation (neuroimaging, labs) per clinical judgment.
7. No changes needed for asthma at this time. Avoid known headache triggers.
8. Reassess at follow-up visit or sooner if symptoms change.
